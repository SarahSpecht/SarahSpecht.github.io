	Hello! This is Sarah Specht. A note to those viewing this code, I have merely edited this code from a template provided by HTML5 UP. I have not made significant deletions, but instead "commented out" sections that were of no use to me at present. The biggest deletions I have made were changing the content of what words appeared, and deleting links to other pages, as I did not have time to work on a multi-page site. I wanted my viewers to be able to simply scroll through and get a brief, visually pleasing overview of my education and personal life.

										<h3>Bio</h3>
										<p>I am from Somerville, Ohio, and I graduated from Edgewood High School. I am a first-generation college student. I have two brothers, one older and one younger, and I have a twin sister who goes to Denison University. My favorite thing to do is to spend time with these people, and with my older brother's adorable wife and children, too. Here I am (far right), pictured with my siblings.</p>

										<h3>Liberal Arts</h3> 
										<p>I attend The College of Wooster in Wooster, OH. It was a happy accident that I ended up here, and I couldn't be more thankful that I did. The Liberal Arts education has exposed me to a variety of disciplines - including Chemistry and Dance! - which enriches my understanding of my own field and will ultimately make me a more well-rounded and skilled employee.</p>

										 <h3>The Ed Department</h3> 
										<p>This is my favorite place on campus, as the professors are so kind and helpful. I feel prepared for and passionate about my future career in education when I am here, and the opportunities I have been given are invaluable. I've presented at the OAEYC conference and had numerous experiences teaching in the middle school setting thanks to this department. In this picture, I am having a little fun at the OAEYC conference.</p>

										<h3>Sophomore Research</h3> 
										<p>As I am in my sophomore year at the college, I am working with two professors in the Education Department on a research project. We are studying where online students end up after graduating high school, and whether they are successful in the college environment.</p>

										<h3>Independent Study</h3>
										<p>As I move into my junior year, I have plenty of ideas for what I'll work on in my capstone project, ranging from translating literary theory articles to middle-school lexile, to creating a teacher-friendly database to generate reading lists by topic.</p>

										<h3>The Center for Urban Teaching</h3>
										<p>This was one of the toughest experiences I have had in my life. I expected to be naturally good at teaching, and I wasn't. I had a growth mindset, though, and this year I have learned from my mistakes. I love these children as my very first real class, and I treasure what they taught me.</p>
